# HarmonicMotionAnalyser
MATLAB based program to analyse motion equation and parameters.

# Overview
A video is selected to analyze its motion. Proper colour thresholding is done to identify the object and its centroid location is obtained. Every coordinate of centroid is stored and later its extrumum are calculated. All vales are stored then in a csv file. Using elemetry mathematics and retrived data, equation of motion is calculated.
